# Myworld ❤️ Microfrontends

First came across [Microfrontends](https://micro-frontends.org/) on a Arshad Khan talk about the topic. It sounded very interesting on paper for company like ours and we decided to move with it.

For this we need to use [Module Federation NextJS plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@module-federation/nextjs-mf). It seems that it is now under a [paywall](https://app.privjs.com/buy/packageDetail?pkg=@module-federation/nextjs-mf), however, some versions of it are still available in npm. At the time of writing it seems to be above `v3`, however, to experiment with this I've used `v1`, which was the version I've found more documentation about.
